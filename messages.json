What happens when I reach the max token limit for OpenAI?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If the maximum token limit for OpenAI is reached, then I may be unable to process your input or generate a response. This can happen when the conversation becomes too long or complex, or if there are many consecutive requests made in a short period of time. When this occurs, the best course of action may be to end the current conversation and start a new one, or to wait until OpenAI's token limit resets before continuing the conversation."}]
