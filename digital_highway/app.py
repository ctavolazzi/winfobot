# It would be good to have more tests, especially for the individual bot behavior,
# but without more specifics, this should be a good starting point!

# To run the tests, use pytest from the command line:
# $ pytest test_hub.py

# If you want to run a specific test, use the -k flag:
test_create_bots()
test_run()
test_bot_identify()
